# Weather SA1 2016 1910 2022

This is a code repository with demo data and the ability to run on data hosted by CARDAT. https://github.com/cardat/DatSci_weather_sa1_2016_1910_2022. The method of population weighted weather estimates is similar to Option 5 demonstrated in our paper Hanigan, I., Hall, G. & Dear, K.B. A comparison of methods for calculating population exposure estimates of daily weather for health research. Int J Health Geogr 5, 38 (2006). https://doi.org/10.1186/1476-072X-5-38
